 Real Estate CLI Assistant
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) Real Estate Assistant built using Python, designed to analyze property listings from CSV data files. This tool enables users to interact with real estate data through natural-language-style commands to uncover insights such as:

 Cheapest cities by price per Marla

 Most expensive areas in a selected city

 Average price or area per city

 Property listing trends over time

It performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and on-demand visualizations, making it ideal for learning data science principles in a practical real estate context.

 Features
ðŸ”¹ CLI-based natural language-style interaction

ðŸ”¹ Cleans and standardizes noisy real estate data:

Converts inconsistent price formats (lakh, crore, arab)

Converts area units (sqft, kanal, marla)

Converts posted dates like "3 weeks ago" into timestamps

ðŸ”¹ Calculates key metrics:

Price per Marla (PPM)

Average price and area per city

ðŸ”¹ Handles outliers and missing data

ðŸ”¹ Interactive graph prompts (matplotlib visualizations)

ðŸ”¹ Supports user queries like:

"cheapest city"

"most expensive areas in Lahore"

"average price in Karachi"

"trend in listings"
